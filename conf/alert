##### Primary configuration settings #####
##########################################
# The address of the interface to bind to
#interface: 0.0.0.0
#
# The number of worker threads to start, these threads are used to manage
# return calls made from minions to the master, if the master seems to be
# running slowly, increase the number of threads
#worker_threads: 3
#
# The port to begin binding workers on, the workers will be created on
# increasingly higher ports
#worker_start_port: 45156

# The port used by the communication interface
#ret_port: 4507

# The root directory prepended to these options: pki_dir, cachedir, log_file.
#root_dir: /

# Directory used to store public key data
#pki_dir: /etc/salt/pki

# Directory to store job and cache data
#cachedir: /var/cache/salt

#####        Security settings       #####
##########################################
# Enable "open mode", this mode still maintains encryption, but turns off
# authentication, this is only intended for highly secure environments or for
# the situation where your keys end up in a bad state. If you run in open more
# you do so at your own risk!
#open_mode: False

# Enable auto_accept, this setting will automatically accept all incoming
# public keys from the minions
#auto_accept: False

#####         Cluster settings       #####
##########################################
# Salt supports automatic clustering, salt creates a single ip address which
# is shared among the individual salt components using ucarp. The private key
# and all of the minion keys are maintained across the defined cluster masters
# The failover service is automatically managed via these settings

# List the identifiers for the other cluster masters in this manner:
# [saltmaster-01.foo.com,saltmaster-02.foo.com,saltmaster-03.foo.com]
# The members of this master array must be running as salt minions to
# facilitate the distribution of cluster information
#cluster_masters: []

# The cluster modes are "paranoid" and "full"
# paranoid will only distribute the accepted minion public keys.
# full will also distribute the master private key.
#cluster_mode: paranoid

######         Logging settings       #####
###########################################
# The location of the alert log file
#log_file: /var/log/salt/alert
# The level of messages to send to the log file.
# One of 'info', 'quiet', 'critical', 'error', 'debug', 'warning'.
# Default: 'warning'
#log_level: warning
#
# Logger levels can be used to tweak specific loggers logging levels.
# Imagine you want to have the salt library at the 'warning' level, but, you
# still wish to have 'salt.modules' at the 'debug' level:
#   log_granular_levels: {
#     'salt': 'warning',
#     'salt.modules': 'debug'
#   }
#
#log_granular_levels: {}
